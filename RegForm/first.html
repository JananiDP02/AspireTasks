<h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
<p>HyperText: HyperText or “text wrapped within a text.” is very similar to a hyperlink, but contains an underlying text which, when clicked, initiates a redirection to a new webpage.</p>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS is designed to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as font, layout, and colors.</p>
